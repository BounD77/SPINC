## Overview

SPINC is an Open-Source NiMH charging station that can automatically load and eject AA battery cells. Simply drop batteries into the top of the device, regardless of their polarity. The internal mechanism picks up one cell at a time and fast-charges them sequentially. Up to 7 fully charged batteries can be conveniently stored inside the device for easy access. In addition, SPINC doubles as a desk clock, displaying the date and time on its high-resolution LCD.
